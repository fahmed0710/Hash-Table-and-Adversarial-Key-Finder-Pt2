# Hash-Table-and-Adversarial-Key-Finder-Pt2

Compute the percentage of the hash functions that map at least 10 keys to a fixed value (that can be any number between 0 and m-1)  as follows:

Let x be the number of the hash functions that map at least 10 adversarial keys to a fixed value (that can be any number between 0 and m-1)

Let y be the total number of hash functions defined by the given parameters (m,n,p)  

y = (p-1)*p by definition 

Then, percentage = x/y = (100*x/y) %
